public class MouseMap {

//(3 points) Modify Exercise 2 so you use an Iterator to move through the List while calling hop( ).
//Take the Mouse class in Exercise 2 and put it into a Map instead,
// associating the name of the Mouse as a String (the key) for each Mouse (the value) you put in the table.
// Get an Iterator for the keySet( ) and use it to move through the Map,
// looking up the Mouse for each key and printing out the key and telling the mouse to hop( ).
